Bronx Man Who Was Drugged And Robbed By Cardi B Says ‘It Was Better Than Listening To Her Music’
NEW YORK – Bronx man who was drugged and robbed by Cardi B six years ago has come forward to state that it was still a more enjoyable experience than listening to any of her music.

The rapper confessed that she used to drug and rob men who were sexually interested in her while she worked as a stripper.

Now, one of her victims has come forward to talk about his ordeal.

‘She took me back to a sleazy motel and poured me a drink. Next thing I know I was waking up ten hours later and the contents of my wallet were stolen. At least I had a good night’s sleep though,’ said the victim.

‘But whenever I’ve accidentally heard one of Cardi B’s songs I’ve suffered from nausea, vomiting and migraines. They’re an altogether worse experience than getting drugged and robbed by her,’ he told us.

Cardi B’s music could now be forced to come with a health warning, a move that many say should have happened years ago.
