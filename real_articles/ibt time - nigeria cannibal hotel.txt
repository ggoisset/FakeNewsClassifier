A restaurant in the Nigerian state of Anambra has been shut down after the authorities reportedly found it has been selling dishes made of human meat.

The police recovered at least two fresh human heads when they arrested 11 people from the restaurant including the owner, six women and four men, following a tip-off.

The blood-soaked heads were found wrapped in cellophane sheets.

Officials have also seized two AK-47 rifles, other weapons, dozens of rounds of ammunitions and several mobile phones during the raid.

"Each time I came to market, because the hotel is very close to the market, I always noticed funny movements in and out of the hotel; dirty people with dirty characters always come into the hotel. So, I was not surprised when the police made this discovery in the early hours of yesterday," a local resident told the Osun Defender.

A pastor, who was shocked to know that what he had eaten was human meat, complained to the police.

"I went to the hotel early this year, after eating, I was told that a lump of meat was being sold at N700 (L2.5), I was surprised. So I did not know it was human meat that I ate at such expensive price," the unidentified pastor said.

Reports of cannibalism sometimes emerge in Nigeria, but this is the first time a restaurant has been booked for selling human meat dishes.
